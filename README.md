# github-contributions

WIP

## Getting Started

1. Start the application: `GITHUB_AUTH=user:pass lein run`
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and look up a user's contributions.

## Limitations

* In Chrome, if you look up a couple of different users and then enter
  a direct user url e.g. /defunkt, going backwords and forwards in
  your browser will be wonky.
